Sprint 5 included a lot of hard work from our team and the overall quality of the code we are contributing has grown to a higher standard. 
The team was, unfortunately, low on manpower again as Leigh was ill for a portion of the sprint but we were still able to accomplish our goals and create 
a substantial end product.
