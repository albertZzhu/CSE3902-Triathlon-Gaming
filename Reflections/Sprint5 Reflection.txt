Sprint 4 was a weird one for our team, since we lost a member. Less manpower, combined with not having class for a week led us to be slightly behind in our plans, leading to a backlog for this sprint.

Even though last sprint we talked about doing better with merging code, that is something we will still need to work on as we finish the semester. I believe our team needs to think of every file created or changed as a task, just so that we can have more consistent merges, even if the “task” itself is not fully fleshed out.

This sprint, we used a different planning feature, Microsoft Planner, which worked better for us, since there are obvious options for dates, members assigned, and if the task is in progress/finished.
