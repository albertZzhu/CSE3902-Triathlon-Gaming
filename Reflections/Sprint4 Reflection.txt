I would say Sprint 4 went alright for our team! 
We got started a little later than we wanted but everything came together smoothly and our game is finally starting to take shape. 
We also used a new planning method with Microsoft planner - it seems like this was updated more regularly than our previous spreadsheets and was easier to read as well.
