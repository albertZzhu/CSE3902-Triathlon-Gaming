Sprint 3 was tough on our team due to a couple personal complications within our group - reducing our manpower to only 4 members at some points of the sprint. Despite this, those who were able worked extra hard to produce the most amount of code. 


I think we’d benefit from communicating more regularly and making an effort to understand each other’s code. It was not always clear who had the most recent code, and merging was made difficult as so many changes were made in individual branches without merging to the sprint 3 branch. 


I believe the merging even to individual branches must be done more often as well, as it is always useful to see what work has been done, but this also goes hand in hand with our Sprint3 branch, since you should merge the most updated building code to it. We should attempt in the next Sprint to merge whatever code builds at the end of each day into the Sprint4 branch[a], so that everyone can merge that code into their individual branches and continue working.


We added more functionality to our planning sheet so people could track their time, however only 3 of the team members used this, and did not use it for the whole sprint. If in the future we did use this consistently, it would allow us to compare workloads and make sure work is being distributed evenly.
