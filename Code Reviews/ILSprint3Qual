Room.cs

Keyi

The way Room has lists of all the objects in the room might make it much easier to use the GameObjectManager. This
could be a case of duplicated code since the ObjectManager has Lists of each, while this class has arrays. The update, draw, and get 
methods (for collision) are very simple and clean. I haven't worked much with the xml files, and so I can't say too much about loadRoom,
but it looks fairly clean as well. I think the refactoring of this class using GOM will make it much simpler and less repeated.

Another issue with this code is that it requires the xml file to be either placed in the Debug folder or the path to be changed depending
on the machine. Once we figure out the best way to manage this, this will be a simple fix, but for now, it can make the project difficult
to manage working in this team environment.
