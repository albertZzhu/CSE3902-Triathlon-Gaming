Sprint 3

Room.cs

Keyi

7 minutes

Most of the code is readable. The xml loadRoom is personally harder for me to understand, since I didnt do as much
research with it, but once I dive into it, it does make sense. There are a lot of nested if-elses in the method, 
but that may just be necessary in order to correctly read the xml file. The update and Draw methods reminded me a lot of the ones
I built for the GameObjectManager, so, as I mentioned in my quality review, I believe these can be somewhat simplified, 
and will be next sprint.
