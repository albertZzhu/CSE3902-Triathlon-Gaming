Sprint 2

NPC1.cs

Keyi

The way that i and index work together with modFunc 
might be able to be simplified to be able to meet the same goal.
In the item class, i used a list of names for sprites with one index, and I
believe that this could be a variable clump that could be shrunk down.
I understand that Mod func returns the index you are on in the list of ints,
but I wonder if there needs to be a seperate function for this or it could be done elsewhere.

I believe that we will have to end up doing this eventually in order
to make the game object manager work, with lists of npcs and 
indexes being stored in there, so the current implementation might need
some work in order to transfer this over into the manager.
