Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
Right off the bat - the instance variables are readable. I appreciate the comment on facing.
Many of the methods are readable, but I get confused when I reach the update method.
I would really appreciate comments explaining each case (or if more needs to be added).
For example, why does attack && damage set the sprite to attacking? shouldnt there be some kind of
damage sprite included?
It's quite a long bit of code - maybe some class methods could be made to break up the update method
for readability?
