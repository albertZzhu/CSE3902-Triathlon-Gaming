structure in each collsion detection and handler class maintains higher conhersion. 
the bug found in playercollsiondetection class is if, for example, player slide into the rectangle texture of a block 
from the right-up vertex, the player will first check whether itself collide with the block from the right edge. if the 
overlaping situation happened, the if-else block will confine the player continue overlapping the block texture comming 
from right. then the player will check whether itself collide with the block from the top edge. if collision happened, 
player will then be moved upward to avoid the steady increasing overlapped area. the plan works very well even the code 
are pretty make sense here. but when running the game, if player move into the coner the collison detection part will begin to
mess up all things. because all 4 directions has been locked. i think that may somehow due to the speed of character. since our 
speed of character moving so fast, the detection class cannot have enough time to detect collision given the current character's situation.
