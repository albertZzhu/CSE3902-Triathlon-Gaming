Sprint 2

SpriteFactory.cs

Leigh Lynch

The overall code quality is good. According to the Professor Kirby's comment, maybe the SpriteFactory class can have the functionality of handling the unfied sprite
sheet for the whole project. All the basic functionalities are satisfied as needed. All the methods remain static thus the SpriteFactory can be accessed from 
everywhere of the whole project. Well done overall!
