The code is readable. This class contains many variables, but I can quickly tell they are highly related to direction-oriented 
functionalities. I can see separate functions responsible for moving the camera in different directions. The only part that has a
little bit of a readability problem was the draw method which contains a big chunk of codes. I can see there are many similar and repeated
codes in this method.
