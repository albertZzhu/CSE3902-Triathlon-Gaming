GameButtonManager.cs

Boru

The way GameButtonManager uses the MouseState might make it much easier to use the MouseController. This
could be a case of a God Object, where the manager has too much power, since it knows exactly how the mouse works. 
The MouseController could simply be passed in like the Game is in the constructor to make the handling of location much simpler.
The update, draw, and initalize methods are very simple and clean, but I think the refactoring of this class using MouseController will make it better.

One other thing I noticed about this code is that the list of buttons could likely be included in the GameObjectManager, 
and we would not necessarily need a ButtonObjectManager (if it is refactored), which would make this duplicated code.
Since this code also led to commands being moved, I think the refactoring could help organize our code base as well.
