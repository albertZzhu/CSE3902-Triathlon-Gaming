GameButtonManager.cs

Boru

The code is very readable. It contains simple and short methods, as well as being fairly well data driven. I think, as mentioned in the quality review,
the Update method could still be simpler by using the MouseController and the GameObjectManager. I'm not sure if there was a reason why the buttonManager was created
separately, but this is something we will discuss. However, for now, the code functions well and is easy to understand, so it can easily be assimilated later.
