This code is generally in good design. The first problem I see is the magic numbers in the different updates
methods, I cannot understand what does this 4 and 10 stand for in this part of the code. 

Second problem is like I mentioned in the readability review about the draw method, there are many similar and
repeated codes this could cause some maintain problem because if we are going to change one of those cases then other
parts will need to be changed correspondingly.
