half a day to understand the code

The structure in different collision class has higher corhesion.
varibles in these classes are all private.
need a brief comments right before different
functions to increase the reader's understandability.
less enumberic values, differernt function calls can all 
project onto a real world meaning, which means increased 
the readability. 
try simplify the logical connections inside the if-else blocks.
