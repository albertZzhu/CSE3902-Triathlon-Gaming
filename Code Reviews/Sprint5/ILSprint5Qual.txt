Sprint 5

SpriteFactory.cs and spriteList.txt

The way SpriteFactory creates the sprites is good. The SpriteFactory method is essentially two lines, with additional lines to read the sprites
from the txt file. I think this makes the code look much better, and also reduces many of the magic numbers and strings, instead including them in a txt doc.

I think one thing that could have been simplified in SpriteFactory is the use of multiple strings throughout. I understand that this ends up making the method more
readible, but something that could have had less repeated code is a stringbuilder or something of the sort, and then the same object could have been used and parsed
in order to get each variable the sprite needs to be created.
