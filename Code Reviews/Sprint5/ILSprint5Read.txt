SpriteFactory.cs and spriteList.txt

The code is very readable. The cleanup of the SpriteFactory Initilization was very clean and shortened this method by quite a few lines.
I also think the comments in the code help a lot with understanding, and the parsing of ints is great.
The txt document has good groups of sprites that go together, with the handling of empty lines included in the Factory.
