There are a few magic numbers in calculating positions, i.e. in Position2Node and isValid. 
The purpose of them is not made clear by the code around them. A variable would have been
for these numbers additionally, as it would allow for modification from one point of entry 
(changing the variable instead of changing each instance of the number.)

If you wanted to make NPCs with variations on this AI, there is not immediately a template to follow.
Perhaps adding an interface or more general PathFinder class would allow for future variations to occur.
