Overall the quality is good, but with some coupling quality issues for example the big chunk of if condition 
statements to determine if any key is pressed(if not then keep the sprite still). 
Things need to be imporved: naming convention, coupling problem, CompareState and Execute function should not have parameters. 
Command object constructors should include the receiver so that the command can be executed by anyone.
