the quality of his code follows the maintainability property, since all data packed in its own class. such design follows the design partten(cohesion).
by since we have spritefactory to deal with the animation part of different item texture, the item class don't really care about the animation part. So 
these two classes can work independently. such design lower the coupling issue. pretty clear to see and understable. no any further suggestions on this 
class and its associated command class.
