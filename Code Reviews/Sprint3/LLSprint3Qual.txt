Room Class

First thing I notice is that "loadRoom" doesn't meet naming conventions (should be "LoadRoom"),
obviously very minor.

There is an issue with the file pathing to the level xml document that has been requiring us to 
change the path to our local copy of the file instead of being able to access it from the content
folder. I've tried several things to try and fix this and I don't think I'm the only one - we'll have
to figure it out at some point.

The if statements are quite long and nested - I wonder how we can condense these. Maybe just separating
the functionalities out into different methods... this would help with readability and also decouples
any duplicated code. I think separate LoadBlocks(), LoadItems(), etc, would clean the code up a fair
bit.

TextureHolder...? Is this not what SpriteFactory for?

To me, the route system is clunky and seems very error prone. I think if we standardized it or made 
it so different routes are pre-set and are given readable names... it would make the code much more
digestible. 

Update seems fine.

Level1 Class

I'm apprehensive about having a concrete class for level 1. In the future, I believe the standard 
practice is to create a level loader and, similar to the room class, read in the necessary data from
there.

On a similar note, I get a bad feeling (code smell?) looking at the rooms dictionary with the 
numerical values and standardized strings. My understanding of this, is that having to go in
and manually add a "room18" (as we have yet to add a test room) seems clunky and unreliable with
this method. Instead, I believe you would work through the xml document and do a breadth first search
to get all of the rooms and put them into the dictionary at runtime. 

^^ adding onto this, the 16 later in the in the code (SwitchNext) would also have to be changed.
In a lot of code I've noticed magic numbers. Please do not code with these! Make a variable 
that explains the number's function - this is not only more readable/understandable, 
but allows for standardized adjustments. 

Block Class

There should not be a "SetBlock" method just for changing the block texture. The name of the method
is unclear and we should be using SpriteFactory for this... right? Same goes for "SetItem", etc.
